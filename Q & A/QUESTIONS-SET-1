Q: What is the purpose of creating new networks?

   Containers without user defined networks will use to the default network meaning they will be able to 
   communicate with each other freely. If you want to more restrictive boundaries you create individual 
   networks to isolate containers in groups. 
   
   Let's say you have 3 containers: a frontend, backend and a database. You don't want all the containers to 
   communicate freely to increase security. So you add a user defined bridge network called backend and give it 
   to the backend and database containers since they should be able to communicate. The frontend container only
   needs to communicate with the backend not the database so you create a frontend network and give to the 
   frontend and backend containers. So the backend in the scenario is the man in the middle that can communicate
   with both the frontend and the backend because it shares both networks.
